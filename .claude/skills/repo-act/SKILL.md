# Repo Act: map-generator

## When to Use

- Load this after repo-onboarding when the next step is execution or validation planning.
- Skip it for broad repo overview questions with no action plan yet.

## Debugging Checklist

- Load repo-onboarding first if the repository or area is unfamiliar.
- Run Aethyme Explore on the user task before broad manual search.
- Verify answer candidates before concluding when trust_policy is not answer-safe.
- Identify the nearest fast test or validation command before editing.
- Inspect caution zones before changing generated or vendored areas.

## Validation Checklist

- Run the fastest relevant test command first.
- Check likely entrypoints and impacted callers before finishing.
- Re-run lint/build only after the focused validation passes.
- Document any override-based maintainer note that affected the change plan.

## Useful Commands

- `fast_test`: `cargo test --workspace`
- `build`: `cargo build --workspace`
- `dev`: `cargo run`

## Primary Entrypoints

- `app`: `Procfile:web` (Procfile process entrypoint)
- `cli`: `crates/mapgen-cli/src/main.rs` (tracked Rust binary entrypoint in `.`)
- `test`: `tests` (conventional test root)

## Likely Entrypoints

- `Procfile:web` (Procfile process entrypoint)
- `crates/mapgen-cli/src/main.rs` (tracked Rust binary entrypoint in `.`)
- `crates/mapgen-server/src/main.rs` (tracked Rust binary entrypoint in `.`)
